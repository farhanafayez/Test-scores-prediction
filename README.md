# Test Score Prediction

A neural network made from scratch using numpy and pandas.

## Tech
* [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) - an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - A library for helping in matrix
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) - A data analysis tool

## Get it started

  1) Git clone the folder to your computer
  2) Run the jupyternote book from any repos you like. ( make sure you have either Anaconda or virtual env running jupyternotebook )
  3) Run each block of code to see what happens at each step.
  
# Break down

1) Generate random sleeping hours, and study hours as labels and test scores as features.
2) Use numpy to Average the test scores.
3) Add weights and hyperparameters for nodes.
4) Create neural network with forward propagation.
5) Create the neural network and add back propagation.
